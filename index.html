<h1>Hello there! &#128075;</h1>

<p>My name is Sean, I am a first year masters student at Northeastern University studying computer science. 
    Before that I worked in Hong Kong as a structural engineer and completed a M.S. and B.S. in Civil Engineering from 
    Columbia University and Northeastern University respectively. </p>

<p>Currently, I am looking for internships (summer 2023). Check out my blog and projects where I showcase
    things that I've worked on. If you have any questions please feel free to contact me at yu.sea@northeastern.edu</p>
<p>I made some web apps that apply to structural engineering, namely a
