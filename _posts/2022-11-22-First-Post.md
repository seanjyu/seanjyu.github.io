Welcome to my first blog post! <br><br>
As my first post I thought it would be appropriate to write a little bit on my motivations and what I plan to achieve with this blog.

Most of the posts will be professional and informative in nature but I may drop insights or thoughts that are particular to myself. I will write about topics relating to computer science and/or mathematics but feel free to check my [categories]({%link categories.md%}) to see what other things I write about. As I start this blog I am part way through my first semester at Northeastern studying computer science. Since my background was in civil engineering some of the topics maybe a bit elementary but I plan to (or at least try to!) eventually tackle topics at the graduate level or at the forefront of research.

## Motivations

### Improve writing

Coming from an engineering background I am used to conveying my ideas through construction drawings and engineering reports. I realize writing for a more general audience is a separate skill and look to improve through this blog.

### Implement things that I've learnt

Writing a blog will give me an outlet to implement the things I may have learnt in class or read about.

### Improve learning skills and explore things in depth

With the rapid evolution of computer science it is getting increasingly important to be able to learn new concepts. However, a somewhat underrated point is the need to understand the building blocks of which these technologies are built to be able to further develop new ideas. By documenting these experiments I hope to have a more fundamental understanding of the workings of computer science/mathematical theories and improve my independent learning skills.

### Connecting the dots

As a biproduct of in exploring these in depth I hope to be able to generate 'new' ideas by combining old ones. I understand its more likely that ideas generated through connecting my explorations are likely to be already discovered but maybe eventually it could lead to something new.

### Document learning

Like looking off a tall mountain after you've climbed, it's nice to see the difference from where you've started compared to where you are now.

### Practice discipline and the act of doing/making things

Having been in school most of my life, I realized there is a large difference between learning a concept and applying these concepts to tangible projects. I plan to write a post once every two to three weeks (depending on my school schedule and the content of the blog).

Well, that's all I could think of (at least for now).

I hope you look forward to reading my future posts!
